## My Plan
This is an experimental space to develop and hone my front end development skills using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Everything in development here will be coded by me as much as possible so that I am actually learning.

## What I've done so far:
* Divs made for purpose
  * Trying to use divs where possible to create my own, h1, h2 .etc
* CSS styling
  * display, position, color, background (color and image) , margin, padding, opacity, transitions, alignment
* On click button events -> Javascript
* Javascript transitions
  * document.getElementByID... - to change CSS style/content
  
 ## What I plan on working on:
 * Better design
  * Currently, my design is a very simple black and white space with little to no creativity involved. 
    I would like to create something that is relatively unique that I could be proud of. Vague, but even I don't know where this is heading.
  * I am in the middle of learning this, I want to make my webpage responsive to different resolutions and devices.
    * I have currently done this by using vw/vh or percentage sizes as much as possible but I know you can change the values depending on the media size.
 * More advanced Javascript
  * Currently, I only know a very limited amount of Javascript that will animate my webpage. 
    I want to learn better and more efficient ways of doing what I've done so far.
 * Learn better CSS and HTML (formatting, styling)
  * I am still struggling with display: block, flex, inline .etc and how they interact with eachother.
  * I want cleaner code as currently it is quite messy with possibly many ways to make it far more efficient.
    * Example of this would be to have better formatting, encompassing multiple divs in CSS as much as possible when styling for better efficiency.
    
## Final Note
The development process will be very long and will progress slowly, but changes will happen. When I have free time, I'll work on it until I'm eventually satisfied.
